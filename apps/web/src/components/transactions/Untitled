Check this file, it is a transaction rules component that opens up a model that has some text and the user will be able to choose different filters that can be combined as groups with the different operators. The columns can be description and account, could be type of transaction, could be the value. Based on that, the rules will be defined. Check the exact usage and create a similar transaction rules module or model in the components page, let's say rules or transaction rules, and set the things up. When the user right-clicks, when a selection is there, and clicks and selects "Select rule" or "Create rule," that should open up this model where we pre-populate the description as contains the selected item, and the type of transaction should also be auto-selected in the rule.
